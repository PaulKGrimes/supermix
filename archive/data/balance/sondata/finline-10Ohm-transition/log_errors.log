      Sonnet Warning- EG2670:
          Conformal Meshing Warning.
          Filename: /ttgsa/data/pkg22/sonnet/balance/finline-10Ohm-transition.son
          When used with conformal meshing, cell size aspect ratios of greater than 2.0 can cause increased error, for example, in shifting the response of a filter.

      Sonnet Warning- EG2670:
          Conformal Meshing Warning.
          Filename: /ttgsa/data/pkg22/sonnet/balance/finline-10Ohm-transition.son
          Junction between conformally meshed polygons joining along line from (276.25,98.2525) to (32.5,26.5025) (microns) on level 1 is too long, associated conformal subsections are being reverted to normal meshing.
