		     Testing the SuperMix Library

Whenever changes or additions are made to SuperMix, regression tests
are performed to try to ensure that the changes do not break working
code or generate other unexpected side effects.

This directory contains the SuperMix regression testing suite. The
contents of this directory include:

  src/           subdirectory containing C++ source files of the
                 test programs

  datafiles/     subdirectory containing data files used by the
                 test programs

  compare.*/     subdirectories containing the reference output
                 for the regression testing on various machines

  cfast          shell script to run a regression test program

  cfast.all      shell script to run all regression tests

  Makefile       builds the regression test programs

To build the regression test suite, execute "make test". The compiled
programs will be put in a subdirectory of this directory named
"exe.<machine>/" where <machine> identifies your machine type.

To run the regression test suite, enter this directory and execute
"cfast.all". The test suite will be run; each test program's output
will be saved and compared to the baseline output from the appropriate
"compare" subdirectory. Any differences will be displayed and saved to
a file. If the tests are all completed successfully, no output will be
displayed.

Following regression testing, the appropriate "compare" subdirectory
will contain three files for each test run:

  <test>.base   The baseline reference program output
  <test>.new    The actual program output
  <test>.diff   Difference between the two outputs, generated by diff

The programs in the test suite are not all good examples of how to use
the SuperMix library or even of how to program in C++ generally. Some
of the programs were written years ago by novice C++ programmers and
do not take advantage of the power of the current SuperMix
version. They are also not very well commented.
