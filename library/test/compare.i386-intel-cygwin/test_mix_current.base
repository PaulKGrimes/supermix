Test mixer_currents device:

The mixer shouldn't know its size yet (size = 0):
m.size(): 0

The arguments to inst_circuit:
int_bias.size() (should be 5): 5
junction_bias_currents.size() (should be 3): 3
number of voltmeters: 1

The mixer should know its size now.
m.size(): 7

The individual junction bias voltages and currents:

     Junction:     V(mVolt):      I(mAmp):
            j1           1.5      0.117412
            j2           1.5      0.117412
            j3           1.5      0.117412

The bias circuit's voltage and current readings:
  V(mVolt):  1.5  I(mAmp):  0.352236
